// BRAINSTORMING IDEAS FOR GAME 12/22/17 //


A game that keeps drunk drivers off the road

	How?
	
	Play a (drinking game on your phone) || (increasingly harder trivia games) || (chess next move solver) || (driving car game on phone) || 


create a checkbox to see if the user wants to take an uber to the next bar
create a "Do You Feel Lucky?" button that will send the User to a random bar



// WE ARE USING THE BELOW IN ADDITION TO THE TRIVIA QUESTIONS
// USING CHEERS GOVERNOR (drinking game) TO TEST USER'S MEMORY AS THE NIGHT GOES ON

Use a memory game to see if the user is drunk:

Numbers 1-21 || let the user select how many numbers to use in the game.
Present a number to the user and ask him to input a response.
Capture the response and connect it to the number. 
As the night goes on it becomes harder to remember all of the user inputs.

// TURNING THE DUI APP INTO A SOCIAL APP //

// EITHER YOU GO HOME WITH YOUR GPUZZ BUDDY OR UBER AUTO BOUNCES YOU HOME //


Because we all don't understand everything.. meet someone new and answer trivia together!

A social app that uses 1 or more users to answer "increasingly difficult" trivia questions -- because as you drink more and the categories change,
any and every other question becomes more difficult to answer.
